	\title{Chromatin Architecture Post UVC damage}
	\maketitle
	\section{Experimental Settings and Findings}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Cell type used: U20S, which are human osteosarcoma cells;
		\item H3.3 histones are tagged 48 hours before experiments using the SNAP-tag method, tag color is red;
		\item Repair factors XFP are labeled with GFP;
		\item a region of $20 \mu m^2$ was photo-activated 8-10 hours before UVC;
		\item UVC damage is induced in a region of the cell using a 266 nm laser (0.266 $\mu m$);
		\item Changed to the red fluorescence signal were measured in the entire volume of the cell, post UVC;
		\item Images were acquired using confocal microscopy, with an auto-focus module on, to acquire images from the best focal plane;
		\item Fluorescence intensity were normalized against values measured in undamaged nucleus;
		\item Fluorescence loss at irradiated sites was determined by dividing the intensity in the illuminated area by the intensity of the entire nucleus after background subtraction;
		\item Illuminated area was defined 15 minutes post UVC based on GFP labeled repair factors and was kept similar throughout measurements;
		\item Fluorescent recovery was measured relative to previous illumination starting from the frame with the minimal fluorescent values;
		\item 2D projection of the 3D images were obtained by \textit{maximal intensity z projection}
		\item For sensitivity, most of the cell H3.3 fluorescence was photo-bleached, aside from the region of UVC illumination;
		\item 20\% loss of H3.3 signal from the \textit{entire nucleus} was detected after photo-bleaching the fluorescence patch;
		\item However, using UVC in the fluorescent patch led to 40\% loss of parental H3.3 signal, while no detectable loss was seen in the entire nucleus;		
		\item The depletion of fluorescence in the center of the damage area, 15 minutes post UVC, was accompanied by an increase of density at tits boundary, balancing the loss;
		\item 20\% loss of DNA signal in the damage region, accompanied by an expansion of the region was observed 15 minutes postUVC;
		\item The expansion of the damage region depends on the dose of repair-factor;		
		\item The early repair factor DDB2 recruits histone chaperons HIRA, which promotes the deposition of newly synthesized histones at UVC sites;
		\item newly synthesized histones are detectable in the repair region only 45 minutes post UVC;
		\item Histone chaperons do not participate in histone redestribution after UVC irradiation;

	\section{Model and Parameter Estimation}
	For reasons of convenience we will work in units of $100 nm$. Parameter values calculated in the subsection below will be converted to this measure when simulated. 
	
	\subsection{Nucleus Size}
	 Cells' cross-section are 240 $\mu m^2$ in the $x-y$ plane and $11 \mu m$ in height, giving an average radius of $r_c=7.25 \mu m$.  \ref{fig:histoneMarkBeforeDamage}), The red fluorescence represent the histones.

		\end{figure}
		
	\subsection{The UV beam}
	UV beam has 3 $\mu m^2$ section, yielding a radius of $r_{uv}=\sqrt{\frac{3}{\pi}}\approx 1 \mu m$. 
	
    \subsection{Histone Density}
		We consider histones to be uniformly distributed in the nucleus and in the damage zone. There are $3\times 10^6$ histones marked, which makes their density $3\times 10^6 /(4 \pi 7.25^3)\approx 630$ histones/$\mu m^3$
		The expected number of histones in the UV beam region is $14.5\pi \times 630\approx 30,000$ histones, assuming the beam is shot through the center of the sphere. 
    
    \subsection{DNA density}
	to be determined	
	
	\subsection{Distribution of damage sites}
	to be determined
	
	\subsection{Defining the region of interest}
	We model the experiment in a region around the damage zone rather than the entire nucleus. We define a region of interest (ROI) in terms of raiuds of the UVC beam radius. The area expanded after UVC occupies $10 \mu m^2$ which gives 3 times the UVC beam radius. We therefore set the radius of the ROI $r_{roi}=3\mu m$.
					    
	\subsection{The chromatin}	
     The chromatin is modeled as a Rouse polymer of $N$ monomers connected by harmonic springs. The dynamics of the polymer is governed by 3 forces: thermal fluctuations, spring force, and bending force.
     Thermal diffusion fluctuation, resulting from the random collision of the polymer with the particles of its surrounding, and is given by 
     \begin{equation*}
     F_d(t) = \sqrt{2D}\frac{dw}{dt}
     \end{equation*}
      with $D$ the diffusion constant, defined by $\frac{k_BT}{\xi}$, $k_B$- the Boltzmann constant, $T$- the absolute temperature in Kelvin, $\xi$-the friction coefficient, and $w$ is a standard white Gaussian noise. 
            
     The spring force, derived from an harmonic potential of springs connecting neighboring monomers, is given by
     \begin{equation*}
      F_e(t) = -\gamma_e\frac{3k_BT}{2b^2}\frac{\partial}{\partial R_n}\sum_{n-1}^{N-1}(R_n(t)-R_{n+1}(t)^2
     \end{equation*}
     with $\gamma_e>0$ spring constant, $b$- the standard deviation of the distance between monomers, and $R_n(t)$ is the 3D position of the $n^{th}$ monomer.
     
     Bending force on the $n^{th}$ monomer is defined in terms of the angles $\theta_i$ between three adjacent monomers of the chain, $n,n+1,n+2$, and the opening angle $\theta_0$
     \begin{equation*}
     F_b(R_n) = -\gamma_b\frac{3k_BT}{2b^2}\frac{\partial}{\partial R_n}\sum_{i=1}^{N-2}(\cos(\theta_i(t))-\cos(\theta_0))^2
     \end{equation*}
               
     The differential equation describing of motion of the chain is thus 
     \begin{equation*}
     \frac{dR_n(t)}{dt}= F_e +F_b +\sqrt{2D} \frac{dw}{dt}     
     \end{equation*}
     
    \subsection{Model Parameters}
      Parameters used in simulations are set proportional to of the quantity $\frac{3K_bT}{b^2}$, which we fix to be 1 by setting the friction factor $\xi=1$. 
    \subsubsection{b} 
      we set $b=\sqrt{3} \times 100 nm$, 
    \subsubsection{number of monomers}
      The number of monomers, $N$, is determined by setting the polymer's radius of gyration to covers the ROI. The radius of gyration is given by $\sqrt{N/6}b$, equating it to $3\mu m$ we get $N\approx 1800$ 
                     
     \subsubsection{the Spring constant}
       We set the spring constant $\gamma_s =1$
     \subsubsection{The bending constant}
       bending constant is defined according to the opening of the chromatin up to 15 minutes post UVC.
