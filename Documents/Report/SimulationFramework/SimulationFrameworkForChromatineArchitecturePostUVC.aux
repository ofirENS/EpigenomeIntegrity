Following UV-C irradiation, cross-links (dashed lines in box) to and from damaged monomers are removed. \textbf  {C.} crowding of repair proteins is simulated by regions of exclusion centered around each damaged monomer. An elastic pushing force is applied to surrounding monomers with a maximal affect radius of rp. As a result, the damage region expands until reaching its maximal size 15 minutes post UV-C. The Region of Interest (ROI) is then determined as the circles containing 90\% of the damaged monomers (dashed red circle).}}{3}}
