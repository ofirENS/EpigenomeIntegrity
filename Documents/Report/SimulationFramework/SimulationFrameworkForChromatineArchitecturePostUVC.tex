	\title{Simulation framework for chromatin architecture post UV-C irradiation}
	\subsection{The biological process}
	
	\subsection{The simulation domain}
	We simulate a 3-dimensional domain in accordance with the maximal z-projection performed in experiments. The affect of the UV beam on all layers of the nucleus is considered to be similar. 
	\subsection{The polymer model}
	We use a cross-linked Gaussian chain of $N$ monomers connected by harmonic springs to represent a coarse-grained model of the chromatin. Springs between adjacent monomers are assigned a minimal distance. Cross-linking are added randomly between pairs of monomers by a harmonic spring. Cross-linking measure is given by the percentage of non-nearest neighbor monomers connected of the $N$ monomers of the chain.
