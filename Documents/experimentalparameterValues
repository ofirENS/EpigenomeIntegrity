 
Hi Ofir,

Thanks for your email.
Here is the information you need:

Number of nucleosomes/diploid human cell nucleus: 30 millions
Number of nucleosomes in damaged zone: 6 millions

Damaged zone= cylinder with 3 micron2 section, which is 1:5 of nuclear volume
Damaged zone after expansion (15 min after UVC irradiation)= cylinder with 10 micron2 section

Estimated UVC dose delivered by the laser in our experiments: 600J/m2
This will generate on average 1 damage every nucleosome (because 100 J/m2 gives 1 damage/1 kb and each nucleosome takes 185 bp).

We are now looking at the distribution of the damage within the damaged zone. We will send you the corresponding graph shortly.

Hope it helps.

Do not hesitate to get back to me if you have further questions.

best,

Sophie
