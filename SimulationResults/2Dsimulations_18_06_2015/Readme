This batch of simulations was performed with the function MoveHistonesOnChain.m located within this directory and in the EpigenomicIntegrity folder

Simulations were performed for 5 different number of beas, for each 5 ratios between the bending constant and the spring constant were simulated
the number of beads is [100 200 400 800 1600]

forces constant were proportional to dim*D/b^2 where dim is the dimension,D is the diffusion constant
D was set to 1, b= sqrt(3) and dim =2;

Spring constant was set to dim*D/b^2
bending constant increased as 1*dim*D/b^2, 2*dim*D/b^2,..,5*dim*D/b^2.
Other parameters can be seen in the function MoveHistonesOnChain.m

simulations were ran numRelaxationSteps, after which the diffusion force was set to 0 and recording started
for numRecordingSteps, following, the UV beam was shot through the center of the polymers mass, all beads falling within the 
UV beam area were assigned bending force. Simulation then ran for additional numBeamSteps with the bending force.

Simulation were placeed in a sphereical environment with reflecting boundaries.
Measurement of density were performed on a rectangular region, which was dynamically placed around the polymer's center of mass.
Sizes of the containing sphere (circle in 2d) and the measurement region were proportional to the radius of gyration, sqrt(numBeads/6)*b
